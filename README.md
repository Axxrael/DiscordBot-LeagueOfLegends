# project-repository-hosting/DiscordBot-LeagueOfLegends

This is a repository for an initial dive into Discord bot development. In particular we are looking to create a basic bot that will monitor user messages and reply with useful links/information when it finds shortcodes to help identify information with the Riot League of Legends API for people that may not be familiar with all of the exact specifics of items within the API.



It is intended to write the main logic in Python with a hosted operation in Azure or Google Platform.
